Conventions:
1. Anything ending in _t is a typedef.
2. There shall be no direct printf calls. All console logging will go through a logger function
3. All pointers will be with the varaible name insteady of the type. Ex PointerType *typeName ... 
   and NOT PointerType* typeName ...
4. EVERY glfw and vulkan method must be ran through LOG_IF_ERROR(...) for proper error catching/announcing.
5. Follow the First-In-Last-Out principal for destruction to avoid potential unexpected interdependencies.
6. When defining a new struct, take the time to order the members in descending order of memory size. This
   is a memory optimization since all types take up 8 bytes on their own unless paired together with multiple
   of the same type.
7. Every time malloc(...) is written, IMMEDIATELY write the associated free(...) function so that it isn't 
   forgotten. Just do whatever you needed to bewtween those two calls. Unless that allocation is handled
   elsewhere, obviously.
8. All header files shall start with "#pragma once" to prevent any unintentional function/etc redefinitions.
9. Don't include the semicolon after any C macro. Because macros are replaced as in-lines at compile, the
   semicolon is just an unnecessary no-op that could be added.
10. Follow each malloc with a LOG_IF_ERROR to verify that memory allocation was successful.
11. Have the logged string of every LOG_IF_ERROR on a new line for code legibility.
12. For legibility, when using malloc, use sizeof(...) * numberOfItems in that order.
13. Function naming should be along the lines of objectModifiersVerb. Ex: swapchainDestroy(). This will make
    context-specific typing recommendations better.
14. Any function that logs things should start with log. Ex: LOG_IF_ERROR or logCapabilitiesInfo
15. Any struct member that contains a pointer shall start with a 'p' ex: 
   typedef struct { ... GLFWwindow *pWindow, ... } exampleStruct;

Engine:
1. The world will be defined by x/y chunk coordinates and a const max height. When referencing a chunk,
   there will be no y coordinate. Thus, this will happen on a purely 2d plane. These chunk coordinates
   are signed 32-bit integers.
