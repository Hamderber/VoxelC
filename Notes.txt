Conventions:
1. Anything ending in _t is a typedef.
2. There shall be no direct printf calls. All console logging will go through Logger
3. All pointers will be with the varaible name insteady of the type. Ex PointerType *typeName ... 
   and NOT PointerType* typeName ...
4. EVERY glfw and vulkan method must be ran through LOG_ERROR(...) for proper error catching/announcing.
5. Follow the First-In-Last-Out principal for destruction to avoid potential unexpected interdependencies.

Engine:
1. The world will be defined by x/y chunk coordinates and a const max height. When referencing a chunk,
   there will be no y coordinate. Thus, this will happen on a purely 2d plane. These chunk coordinates
   are signed 32-bit integers.
2.
